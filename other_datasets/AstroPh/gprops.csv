description,"Scientific collaborations between authors of papers submitted to arxiv.org, under 5 categories: gr-qc, astro-ph, cond-mat, hep-ph, and hep-th categories, spanning January 1993 to April 2003. If an author i co-authored a paper with author j, the graph contains a undirected edge from i to j. If the paper is co-authored by k authors this generates a completely connected (sub)graph on k nodes."
